Even though we went to Prague a few years ago, we liked the idea of having more Czech *pivo* (beer) and playing tour guide for our final week with Laura's parents. While exploring Old Town by foot was convenient for most things, we figured we would get some of the best views on a boat cruise and a bit of style from an "old" car tour.

Our first stop in Prague was the Old Town Square for ~~beer~~ the famous astronomical clock tower. Dating back to medieval times (it was installed in 1410), the clock has an array of mechanisms that detail the positions of the sun, moon, and what month it is - but most people really go to see "The Walk of the Apostles" which happens on the hour. These moving sculptures draw a HUGE crowd so you can always tell when it's getting close.

In addition to the beautiful Old Town, Prague has a unique blend of old historical sites peppered in with modern architecture and design. The Old Jewish Cemetery was across the street from our Airbnb and is the largest Jewish cemetery in Europe. Just down the street from this is the modern Dancing House, whose design was met with controversy as it is in stark contrast to the rest of the city's architecture. Across the river is the John Lennon Wall, which has been a symbol of peace and love since the 1980s amidst the communist era. Also on the west bank of the Vlata River is the historic Prague Castle, which has an area so large the Guinness Book of Records named it ["the largest ancient castle in the world!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Castle)

Prague has more to offer than just pretty sights - the most obvious being Czech beer! Most places offered Pilsner Urquel (literally "original pilsner") and Budweiser. No, it is not the same as American Budweiser. This is a Czech original that is much older and much better! We paired our beers with hearty and delicious Czech food, some of which is even made with beer! The most notable was the beer cheese, which was an *interesting* culinary experience. Sounds good on paper... but our only way to describe it is that it tasted like a fart.

Continuing our culinary journey, no trip to Prague would be complete without trying some absinthe. We'll just let you see for yourself how delicious it was.

Prague was our last stop with Laura's parents. It was an eventful two weeks full of beautiful sights and delicious beers. Thanks for coming, mom and dad!
