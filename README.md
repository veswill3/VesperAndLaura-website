# VesperAndLaura.com (will be soon)

A wedding website for, you guessed it, Vesper and Laura

to compile less
```sh
$ lessc less/freelancer.less css/freelancer.css
```

The original template that I started the wedding website with was called [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
I also added the [Bare template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/) for the main splash page (temporarily)
