In the last month we have traveled to nine cities in two countries: [Pushkar]({% post_url 2016-12-15-Pushkar-India %}), [Jaipur]({% post_url 2017-01-04-Jaipur-India %}), [Agra]({% post_url 2017-01-06-Agra-India %}), [New Delhi]({% post_url 2017-01-20-New-Delhi-India %}), [Varanasi]({% post_url 2017-01-21-Varanasi-India %}), and [Kolkata]({% post_url 2017-01-22-Kolkata-India %}) in India; and Bangkok, Ayutthaya, and Chiang Mai in Thailand. We’ve only been in Thailand a week now, but so far we are in love with it. Maybe we’ll end up extending our 30 day tourist visa!


## One Month in India

Looking back on our month in India, it was probably the country we will simultaneously love and hate the most. We loved the food, the people, and the sights, but each of those also had their drawbacks. We love trying street food, but not when dishes are washed in sewer water. We love meeting people and learning about their culture and lives, but not when overly pushy vendors make you not want to talk to anyone. We love visiting new places, but so many beautiful and sacred sites are littered with trash and shit (literally - cow, dog, and even human excrement is everywhere). India was a constant assault to the senses. We’re glad we did it: we got to try amazing food, meet new friends, and have memories that will stay with us for a lifetime. However, we’re still trying to process everything we experienced and want to make sure we portray it correctly so it might be awhile until you get to see the pictures. 


## Welcome to Thailand!

Given what we said about India, it’s easy to see why Thailand is a breath of fresh air - literally! The streets aren’t choked with smog or covered in trash! But let’s be honest: our love of Thailand began with the food. We have finally found a country that rivals Mexican street food! We can’t say one is better than the other - that’s like comparing apples and oranges - but the food here is amazing. We ate meat about three times in India so we’re making up for it here. In less than a week we have already eaten chicken, pork, beef, and duck - although we did skip over the fried bugs. Maybe we’ll try them before we leave, but that may require a bit of liquid courage.
