We have had a super busy month - too busy to do much writing that is! We had a blast hanging out with Lehar, Mark, Carl, and Jim for various parts of our journey the last few weeks. 

In the last month we have traveled to fifteen cities in four countries: [Gmunden, Bad Ischl, Hallstatt, and Napplach]({% post_url 2016-08-24-Austria-and-Slovenia %}) in Austria; [Lake Bled, Lake Bohinj, and Brezje]({% post_url 2016-08-24-Austria-and-Slovenia %}) in Slovenia; [Krk Island, Plitvice Lakes National Park, Zagreb]({% post_url 2016-09-06-Croatia-part-one %}), [Dubrovnik, Split, Šolta Island, and Zadar]({% post_url 2016-09-24-Croatia-part-two %}) in Croatia; and [Budapest]({% post_url 2016-10-05-Budapest-Hungary %}) in Hungary. We arrived today in [Kraków]({% post_url 2016-10-14-Poland %}), Poland, where we're spending a week to eat delicious food, explore the historical sites, and relax after a whirlwind four weeks.


### Month 7 Observations

- Vesper's new pet peeve is the European tendency to put the light switch *outside* the bathroom door. It hilariously irks him to no end.
- Laura is now a pro at figuring out any washing machine make or model in any given language.
- Our basic survival questions have transitioned from "Can we drink the water?" or "Can we flush toilet paper?" to "How do I use this Italian espresso maker?" or "Do we need to withdraw cash or can we get by entirely on credit?"
- Renting a car is a great way to see the otherwise inaccessible country side, but it usually only makes sense with a group of people. In Europe make sure you plan ahead - last minute rentals are not cheap.
- Croatian beaches are beautiful but mostly rocky. Pro tip: get some good water sandals if you're going to visit - or just develop thick calluses like we did.

### Fast Facts

- Favorite City: Budapest, Hungary
- Prettiest City: Dubrovnik, Croatia
- Best Freebie Moment: "Accidentally" wandering into Plitvice Lakes National Park
- Funniest Rental Car Moment: A Croatian border control officer asking several times why our group of four had rented a smart car. "But seriously, you rented that? On purpose?"
