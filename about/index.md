Hello, we're Vesper and Laura, and we have decided to explore the world!
Not in 30 years when we have retired and made our fortune, but now, while we have no major responsibilities and the physical youth to do it. We don't know exactly how we are going to plan it, pay for it, or stomach it (there's a lot of food to eat out there!), but we know it needs to happen. If you feel inspired, come meet us out there!

## How did we get here?
We met after college at our first big boy job working for a medical software company. It was a great time in our lives where we grew professionally and learned new skills. We worked with awesome people and made many lifelong friends.
We also quickly found out how taxing a fast-paced tech company can be when they don't emphasize work-life balance. After five years we both needed to do something else.

After reviewing our values and life goals, we realized how much we love to travel. We made a leap of faith and quit our jobs so we could start traveling full time. Follow along with us to see how it turns out!
