After a short four-day jaunt in St. Maarten and a brief layover in Panama City we have finally arrived in Mexico City! Our year of travel has finally begun and we could not be more excited.

We are still getting into the travel groove and hope to start posting on a regular basis, but I think it depends on the quality of internet.

In case you were curious what someone would pack for a year long trip, here is a slightly abbreviated list of what we ended up bringing along:

- Passports
- Cards and some money
- Toiletries
- Meds and first aid
- 5 changes of underwear and socks
- 5 shirts
- 2 pullovers
- A warm fleece
- 2 sets of pants
- Sandals
- Sneakers
- Hiking boots
- A raincoat
- Water bottle and UV sanitizer
- Swimsuit
- Laptops
- Camera
- Cell phone
- Kindles
- Knife
- Clothesline
- Duct tape and para cord (just in case)
- A deck of cards

It all fits in the bag and it's not too heavy, but I imagine we will find that we brought too much and have to whittle it down a bit on the road.
